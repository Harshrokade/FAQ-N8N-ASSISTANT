# 🤖 Automated FAQ Assistant (n8n + OpenAI + Pinecone)

This project is an **AI-powered FAQ assistant** built with **n8n**.  
It automatically reads FAQ files uploaded to Google Drive, stores them in a vector database, and assists clients with instant answers via chat.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 📂 1. Build the Knowledge Base
- **Google Drive Trigger** → starts when a new FAQ file is uploaded.  
- **Download File** → fetches the uploaded FAQ document.  
- **Default Data Loader** → extracts text from the document.  
- **Recursive Character Text Splitter** → breaks large text into small chunks.  
- **OpenAI Embeddings** → converts text chunks into embeddings (numerical vectors).  
- **Pinecone Vector Store** → saves embeddings in a vector database for semantic search.

### 💬 2. Assist the Client
- **When Chat Message Received** → trigger when a client sends a question.  
- **OpenAI Embeddings** → convert the client’s question into an embedding.  
- **Pinecone Vector Store (Search)** → find the most relevant FAQ chunks.  
- **AI Agent (OpenAI Chat Model)** → generate a polite, professional response using the retrieved FAQ context.  
- **Send Back Response** → the client instantly receives an accurate answer.
